# Welcome to the Folded Corner Rework!

[Here is a link to a video demo of our application.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Xb0rU7NA7cOpqSZ0PfOS3Ne2o_dY6dY/view?usp=sharing)

This is a rework of a previous web development project. We aimed to integrate and experiment with new features and backend functionality in this project.

## What's New:
Here is a breakdown about the new things you will find in this rework.
### Firebase:
This version of the project features Firebase integration, allowing us to use the inbuilt functionality of the Realtime Database as well as the Google OAuth2.0 integrated SDK.

### Google Books:
Our repository of books is now provided using the Google Books API. Our application now has access to over 40 million titles in multiple languages.

### View Transitions:
This is an experimental development that is ongoing by Google in collaboration with W3C working group standards. This implementation allows for single page application feel and transitions over multi page applications. The view transitions API **only supports Google Chrome**. The web application will function otherwise normally without transitions in other browsers.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run 'npm install'
3. run 'node app.js'

You can now navigate to the port specified and access the web application.
